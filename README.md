# Ransac_Data_Fitting


There are 5 python files:
1) Least_Square_Regularization.py - Code for least square method has been implemented
2) OLS_final - Ordinary Least Squares method for line fitting is implemented.
3) TLS_final - Total Least Squares method for line fitting is implemented.
4) RANSAC_final - Random Consensus method for line fitting with outlier rejection has been implemented. 
5) Eigen_Covar_Plot - This code plots the graphical representation of the covariances of the dataset, in form of eigenvectors.
